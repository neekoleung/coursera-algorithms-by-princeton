# Percolation
* [Percolation.java](https://github.com/neekoleung/coursera-algorithms-by-princeton/blob/master/percolation/Percolation.java): Models a percolation system using an *n-by-n* grid of sites. Every site has one of the three status: __*blocked / opened / full*__. This program provides methods to construct the system, open the sites, count the number of open sites, judge a site is open or not and evaluate if a system percolates.

* [PercolationStats.java](https://github.com/neekoleung/coursera-algorithms-by-princeton/blob/master/percolation/PercolationStats.java): Estimates the probability threshold of percolation using the *Monte Carlo Simulation*. This program takes two arguments *n* and *T*, performing *T* independent computational experiments on an *n-by-n* percolation system, and outputs the __Mean__, __Standard deviation__, __95% confidence interval__ of the percolation threshold.
