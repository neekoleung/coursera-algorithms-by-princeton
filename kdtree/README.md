# Kd-Trees

* [PointSET.java](https://github.com/neekoleung/coursera-algorithms-by-princeton/blob/master/kdtree/PointSET.java): __A Brute-force implementation that represents a set of points in the unit square.__ Implemented using [point2D](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/Point2D.html) and [rectHV](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/RectHV.html).

* [KdTree.java](https://github.com/neekoleung/coursera-algorithms-by-princeton/blob/master/kdtree/KdTree.java): __A implementation to the same API based on 2d-tree.__ The class builds a BST with points in the nodes, using the x- and y-coordinates of the points as keys in strictly alternating sequence.

Both classes implements methods of __inserting / searching__ points, __drawing__ points, __range search__ and __nearest-neighbor search__ for points.
