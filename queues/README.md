# Deques and Randomized Queues
* [Deque.java](https://github.com/neekoleung/coursera-algorithms-by-princeton/blob/master/queues/Deque.java): Implements a double-ended queue. This program enables a deque to *add / remove* items from either the front or the back of the data structure.
* [RandomizedQueue.java](https://github.com/neekoleung/coursera-algorithms-by-princeton/blob/master/queues/RandomizedQueue.java): Implements a randomized queue. This program enables the removed items are chosen randomly from the data structure.
* [Permutation.java](https://github.com/neekoleung/coursera-algorithms-by-princeton/blob/master/queues/Permutation.java): A client program takes a command-line integer *k*; reads in a sequence of strings from standard input and prints *k* of them, uniformly at random.
